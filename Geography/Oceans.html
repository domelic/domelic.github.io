                the Pacific Ocean on the west and the Arctic Ocean to the north.</p>

            <p><b>Atlantic Ocean</b>, body of salt water covering approximately one-fifth of Earth’s
                surface and separating the continents of Europe and Africa to the east from those
                of North and South America to the west. The ocean’s name, derived from Greek mythology,
                means the “Sea of Atlas.” It is second in size only to the Pacific Ocean.</p>
            <p>The Atlantic is, generally speaking, S-shaped and narrow in relation to its length.
                The area of the Atlantic without its dependent seas is approximately 31,830,000 square miles
                (82,440,000 square km), and with them its area is about 41,100,000 square miles (106,460,000 square km).
                It has an average depth (with its seas) of 10,925 feet (3,300 metres) and a maximum depth of 27,493 feet
                (8,380 metres) in the Puerto Rico Trench, north of the island of Puerto Rico.</p>
            <p>The ocean’s breadth from east to west varies considerably. Between Newfoundland and Ireland it is about
                2,060 miles (3,320 km); farther south it widens to more than 3,000 miles (4,800 km) before narrowing again
                so that the distance from Cape São Roque, Brazil, to Cape Palmas, Liberia, is only some 1,770 miles (2,850 km).
                Southward it again becomes broader and is bordered by simple coasts almost without islands; between Cape Horn
                and the Cape of Good Hope the ocean approaches Antarctica on a broad front nearly 4,000 miles (6,500 km) wide.</p>

                <img src="images/oceans/pacific-ocean.jpg" alt="Pacific Ocean" style="margin-right:50px;width:350px;height:250px;margin-bottom:200px">
                <figcaption style="margin-top: -192px">Pacific Ocean. Britannica

            </figure>
            <p><b>Pacific Ocean</b>, body of salt water extending from the Antarctic region in the south to
                the Arctic in the north and lying between the continents of Asia and Australia on the west
                and North and South America on the east.</p>
            <p>Of the three oceans that extend northward from the Antarctic continent, the Pacific is by far
                the largest, occupying about a third of the surface of the globe. Its area, excluding adjacent seas,
                encompasses about 63.8 million square miles (165.25 million square km). It has double the area and more
                than double the water volume of the Atlantic Ocean—the next largest division of the hydrosphere—and
                its area more than exceeds that of the whole land surface of the globe. The Pacific Ocean stretches
                from the shores of Antarctica to the Bering Strait through 135° of latitude, some 9,600 miles (15,500 km).
                Its greatest longitudinal extent measures some 12,000 miles (19,300 km) along latitude 5° N, between the
                coasts of Colombia in South America and the Malay Peninsula in Asia. The mean depth of the Pacific (excluding
                adjacent seas) is 14,040 feet (4,280 metres), and its greatest known depth is 36,201 feet (11,034 metres)—in
                the Mariana Trench—also the greatest depth found in any ocean.</p>
            <p>In the Northern Hemisphere the Pacific Ocean meets the Arctic Ocean in the Bering Sea. In the
                Southern Hemisphere the Pacific and Atlantic mix in the relatively narrow Drake Passage between
                Tierra del Fuego in South America and Graham Land in Antarctica. The separation between the Pacific
                and Indian oceans is less distinct, but generally it is considered to lie along the line of islands
                extending eastward from Sumatra, through Java to Timor, thence across the Timor Sea to Cape Londonderry
                in Australia. To the south of Australia the boundary extends across the Bass Strait and thence from
                Tasmania to Antarctica. The portion of the Pacific near Antarctica sometimes is considered to be part
                of the Southern Ocean.</p>
            <p>Because of the pattern of major mountain systems of the globe, a relatively small proportion (one-seventh) of
                the total continental drainage enters the Pacific—a total drainage area of less than about three times the total
                area of Australia. Of the rivers that drain into the Pacific, those of China and Southeast Asia are of the greatest
                importance; the basins of those rivers support more than one-fourth of the world’s population.</p>
            <p>The eastern boundary of the Pacific is associated with the American cordilleran system, which stretches from Alaska
                in the north to Tierra del Fuego in the south. Except for its extreme northern and southern sections, which are
                characterized by fjords and their numerous off-lying islands, and except for the deeply indented Gulf of California,
                the coastal boundary is relatively regular and the continental shelf narrow. The western, or Asiatic, coastal boundary,
                in contrast, is irregular. Although the mountain systems there lie roughly parallel to the coast, as they do on the eastern
                Pacific coastlands, the western Pacific is noted for its many marginal seas. From north to south they include the Bering Sea,
                the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan (East Sea), the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea. Their eastern
                boundaries are formed by southward-jutting peninsulas or island arcs or both. It is of oceanographic significance that the
                great rivers of eastern Asia—including the Amur, the Huang He (Yellow River), the Yangtze, the Xi and Pearl (Zhu), and the
                Mekong—enter the Pacific indirectly by way of the marginal seas.</p>

            <p><b>Arctic Ocean</b>, smallest of the world’s oceans, centring approximately on the North Pole.
                The Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas—the Chukchi, East Siberian, Laptev, Kara, Barents, White, Greenland,
                and Beaufort and, according to some oceanographers, also the Bering and Norwegian seas—are the least-known
                basins and bodies of water in the world ocean as a result of their remoteness, hostile weather, and perennial
                or seasonal ice cover. This is changing, however, because the Arctic may exhibit a strong response to global
                change and may be capable of initiating dramatic climatic changes through alterations induced in the oceanic
                thermohaline circulation by its cold, southward-moving currents or through its effects on the global albedo
                resulting from changes in its total ice cover.</p>
            <p>Although the Arctic Ocean is by far the smallest of the Earth’s oceans, having only a little more than
                one-sixth the area of the next largest, the Indian Ocean, its area of 5,440,000 square miles (14,090,000
                square km) is five times larger than that of the largest sea, the Mediterranean. The deepest sounding obtained
                in Arctic waters is 18,050 feet (5,502 metres), but the average depth is only 3,240 feet (987 metres).</p>
            <p>Distinguished by several unique features, including a cover of perennial ice and almost complete encirclement
                by the landmasses of North America, Eurasia, and Greenland, the north polar region has been a subject of
                speculation since the earliest concepts of a spherical Earth. From astronomical observations, the Greeks
                theorized that north of the Arctic Circle there must be a midnight sun at midsummer and continual darkness
                at midwinter. The enlightened view was that both the northern and southern polar regions were uninhabitable
                frozen wastes, whereas the more popular belief was that there was a halcyon land beyond the north wind where
                the sun always shone and people called Hyperboreans led a peaceful life. Such speculations provided incentives
                for adventurous men to risk the hazards of severe climate and fear of the unknown to further geographic knowledge
                and national and personal prosperity.</p>
