                <p><b>Lake Superior</b>, most northwesterly and largest of the five Great Lakes of North America and one of the world’s largest bodies of fresh water. Its name is from the French Lac Supérieur (“Upper Lake”). Bounded on the east and north by Ontario (Canada), on the west by Minnesota (U.S.), and on the south by Wisconsin and Michigan (U.S.), it discharges into Lake Huron at its eastern end via the St. Marys River. Lake Superior is 350 miles (563 km) long (east to west), and its greatest width is 160 miles (258 km) from north to south. It has a mean surface elevation of 600 feet (180 metres) above sea level and a maximum depth of 1,332 feet (406 metres). The lake’s drainage basin is 49,300 square miles (127,700 square km), exclusive of its surface area of 31,700 square miles (82,100 square km). The lake is so massive and its volume so large that, were it to be emptied at its current rate (with no compensating additions of water), it would take 191 years. Because of its large size (relative to watershed area) and the porous "dam" at its outlet, long-term lake-level fluctuations are much lower than in any of the other Great Lakes—generally less than 1 yard (1 metre). Annual lake-level fluctuations are less than 12 inches (30 cm).</p>

                <p><b>Lake Huron</b>, second largest of the Great Lakes of North America, bounded on the west by Michigan (U.S.) and on the north and east by Ontario (Can.). The lake is 206 mi (331 km) long from northwest to southeast, and its maximum width is 183 mi. The total area of its drainage basin is 51,700 sq mi (133,900 sq km), exclusive of the lake surface area, which is 23,000 sq mi. Inflow into the lake is received from Lake Superior (via the St. Marys River), from Lake Michigan (via the Straits of Mackinac), and from numerous streams draining the adjacent lands. The lake discharges at its southern end into Lake Erie (via the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and the Detroit River). With a mean surface height of 577 ft (176 m) above sea level, the lake reaches a maximum depth of 750 ft. Many islands lie in the northeastern part of the lake, notably Manitoulin Island and many others in Georgian Bay and the North Channel. Scenic Mackinac Island and several others are located near the Straits of Mackinac in the northwest part of the lake, and Saginaw Bay indents the Michigan coast.</p>

                <p><b>Lake Michigan</b>, third largest of the five Great Lakes of North America and the only one lying wholly within the United States. Bordered by the states of Michigan (east and north), Wisconsin (west), Illinois (southwest), and Indiana (southeast), it connects with Lake Huron through the Straits of Mackinac in the north. The lake is 321 miles (517 km) long (north to south); it has a maximum width of 118 miles (190 km) and a drainage basin of about 45,500 square miles (118,000 square km), exclusive of its surface area, which is 22,300 square miles (57,757 square km). With a mean surface elevation of 579 feet (176 m) above sea level, the lake has a maximum depth of 923 feet (281 m). Currents are slight, with a generally southward drift along the western side, a northward drift along the eastern side, and at times counterclockwise swirls in the southern basin and around the Beaver Island group in the north. Approximately 100 streams flow into the lake, only a few of which are of appreciable size. The Manistee, Pere Marquette, White, Muskegon, Grand, Kalamazoo, and St. Joseph rivers enter the lake from the east. The Fox and Menominee rivers flow into Green Bay, a northwestern arm of the lake. The Chicago River flowed into the southwestern end of the lake but was reversed in 1900 so that it now drains through the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal into the Des Plaines River at Joliet, Ill. The northern end of the lake contains all of the islands, the largest of which is Beaver Island, Michigan.</p>

                <p><b>Lake Erie</b>, fourth largest of the five Great Lakes of North America. It forms the boundary between Canada (Ontario) to the north and the United States (Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York) to the west, south, and east. The major axis of the lake extends from west-southwest to east-northeast for 241 miles (388 km), and the lake has a maximum width of 57 miles. The total area of the lake’s drainage basin is 30,140 square miles (78,062 square km), exclusive of surface area, which is 9,910 square miles. The lake’s principal tributary rivers are the Detroit (carrying the discharge of Lake Huron), Huron, and Raisin rivers of Michigan; the Maumee, Portage, Sandusky, Cuyahoga, and Grand rivers of Ohio; the Cattaraugus Creek of New York; and the Grand River of Ontario. The lake discharges at its eastern end through the Niagara River, and its western end contains all of the islands, the largest being Pelee Island, Ontario. With a mean surface height of 570 feet (170 metres) above sea level, Erie has the smallest mean depth (62 feet) of the Great Lakes, and its deepest point is 210 feet. Because of its small size and shallow character, the lake has a comparatively short water-retention time of 2.6 years. Storms frequently cause short-period fluctuations in lake level that can amount to several feet at the ends of the lake. It is an important link in the St. Lawrence Seaway. The New York State Barge Canal has an outlet at Tonawanda, New York, on the Niagara River, and one of its branches enters Lake Erie at Buffalo.</p>

                <p><b>Lake Ontario</b>, smallest and most easterly of the Great Lakes of North America. It is bounded on the north by Ontario (Can.) and on the south by New York (U.S.). The lake is roughly elliptical; its major axis, 193 miles (311 km) long, lies nearly east to west, and its greatest width is 53 miles (85 km). The total area of the lake’s drainage basin is 24,720 square miles (64,025 square km), exclusive of the lake’s surface area, which is 7,340 square miles (19,011 square km). The Niagara River is the main feeder of the lake; others include the Genesee, Oswego, and Black rivers from the south and the Trent River from the north. The 30-mile-wide eastern extremity of the lake is crossed by a chain of five islands, where the lake discharges into the St. Lawrence River near Kingston, Ont. With a mean surface elevation of 243 feet (74 m) above sea level, Lake Ontario has a mean depth of 283 feet (86 m), and its deepest point is 802 feet (244 m). A general surface current (8 miles a day) flows toward the east and is strongest along the south shore. The Welland Canal (navigational) and the Niagara River (natural) serve as connections with Lake Erie to the southwest. Lake Ontario is linked with the New York State Barge Canal at Oswego, N.Y., and with Lake Huron’s Georgian Bay via the Trent Canal at Trenton, Ont. The Rideau Canal runs northeastward in Ontario from Kingston to Ottawa.</p><br>
